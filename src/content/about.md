## About this site

This site is built as part of my talk "Build Your Next Website with React, GatsbyJS, and Netlify". It is used to demonstrate deploying a Gatsby site into a cloud hosting service, in this case [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Gatsby is a blazing-fast static site generator for React. It allows you to use the latest web technologies – React, Webpack and GraphQL – to build static pages from whichever source you prefer – from Markdown, to even legacy CMSes like WordPress.
